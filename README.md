# Next.js 15 Server Component Silent Crash on Nested API Fetch Failure

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15 server components where a failure in a nested data fetching operation can lead to a silent crash, resulting in a generic 500 error without clear debugging information.

## Problem

When using server components to fetch data from multiple sources, a failure in one of these fetches (due to network issues, API errors, or database timeouts) might not be properly handled, causing the whole server component to fail without providing specific error details.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling during each fetch call.  This includes explicitly catching errors, logging them for debugging, and providing appropriate fallback mechanisms (such as displaying an error message to the user) instead of letting the error propagate silently.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`. 
4. Observe the behavior in the browser; the page might intermittently show a 500 error without informative detail.
